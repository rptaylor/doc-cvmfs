Release Notes for CernVM-FS 2.7.0
=================================

CernVM-FS 2.7 is a feature release that comes with performance improvements,
new functionality, and bugfixes.

CernVM-FS 2.7 includes support for the new platform EL8 (RHEL8, CentOS8, etc.),
Debian 10, and macOS 10.15 "Catalina".

As with previous releases, upgrading should be seamless just by installing the
new package from the repository. As usual, we recommend to update only a few
worker nodes first and gradually ramp up once the new version proves to work
correctly. Please take special care when upgrading a client in NFS mode.

For Stratum 0 servers, all transactions must be closed before upgrading.
For Stratum 1 servers, there should be no running snapshots during the upgrade.
After the software upgrade, publisher nodes require doing
``cvmfs_server migrate`` for each repository.


Fuse 3 Support
--------------

This release adds support for libfuse 3 platforms in addition to libfuse 2. The
libfuse libraries are part of the system's fuse package. The libfuse libraries
take care of the low-level communication with the Fuse kernel module. The
libfuse 3 libraries provide new features and performance improvements; they
can be installed side-by-side with the libfuse 2 libraries. If libfuse 3 is
available and the ``cvmfs-fuse3`` package is installed, the CernVM-FS client
will automatically use libfuse 3, otherwise it falls back to libfuse 2. A
libfuse version can be enforced by setting the ``libfuse=[2,3]`` mount option.

For the EL6 and EL7 platforms, libfuse 3 libraries are provided in the
fuse3-libs package through EPEL.


Pre-mounted Repository
----------------------

This release adds support for "pre-mounted" repositories.  Mounting a CernVM-FS
repository involves calling the ``mount()`` system call on /dev/fuse. This is
ususally done by the ``fusermount`` utility, which is part of the fuse system
package. As of libfuse 3, the task of mounting /dev/fuse can be offloaded to an
external, custom utility.  Such an external executable "pre-mounts" the
repository and allows for easier integration in special environments. This
functionality has been integrated with
`Singularity 3.4 <https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/tag/v3.4.0>`_.
See :ref:`Pre-mounting <sct_premount>` for more details.


POSIX ACLs
----------

This release adds support for storing and enforcing POSIX ACLs. In order to store
ACLs during publication, simply enable extended attributes by setting
``CVMFS_INCLUDE_XATTRS=true`` in the repository's server.conf configuration
file. In order to enforce ACLs on the client side, set ``CVMFS_ENFORCE_ACLS=true``
in the client configuration. Enforcing POSIX ACLs requires libfuse 3 on the
client node. If only libfuse 2 is available, the client will refuse to mount
with enforced ACLs.

Note that enforcing ACLs usually only makes sense in concert with a secure
distribution infrastructure (see :ref:`Large-Scale Data <sct_data>`,
:ref:`Authorization Helpers <sct_authz>`).


Client Performance Instrumentation
----------------------------------

The CernVM-FS client can now record a histogram of wall-clock time spent in the
different Fuse callback routines
(`CVM-1770 <https://sft.its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CVM-1770>`_).
Recording is enabled by setting the client configuration variable
``CVMFS_INSTRUMENT_FUSE=true``. The time distribution histograms are displayed
in the ``cvmfs_talk internal affairs`` command.
